# General ratings

Firstly, let's have a look at the heatmap of IMDb users' episode ratings.

```{r}
ratings <- read.csv2("data.csv")
head(ratings)
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
ratings_matrix <- pivot_wider(ratings[,-4], names_from = Season, values_from = Rating)
```

```{r}
#| output: true

ggplot(ratings, aes(Episode, Season, fill=Rating)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Rating), color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(-0,10),
  colours=c("#D2222D", "#FFBF00", "#007000")) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ratings$Episode), max(ratings$Episode), by = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ratings$Season), max(ratings$Season), by = 1)) 
  
```

We can see that overall the episodes are rated relatively high by the viewers, although there are some exceptions. The mean rating is **`r ratings$Rating %>% mean() %>% round(2)`**. 

## The highest rated episode

The highest rated episode is *`r ratings$Name[which.max(ratings$Rating)]`* (season `r ratings$Season[which.max(ratings$Rating)]` episode `r ratings$Episode[which.max(ratings$Rating)]`) with rating **`r ratings$Rating[which.max(ratings$Rating)]`**.

## The lowest rated episode

The lowest rated episode is *`r ratings$Name[which.min(ratings$Rating)]`* (season `r ratings$Season[which.min(ratings$Rating)]` episode `r ratings$Episode[which.min(ratings$Rating)]`) with rating **`r ratings$Rating[which.min(ratings$Rating)]`**.

# Season ratings

Now let's look at the rating per each season.

```{r}
season_averages <- ratings %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
#| output: true

ggplot(season_averages, aes(x = Season, y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_rating, 1)), vjust = -1) +  
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Average rating") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ratings$Episode), max(ratings$Episode), by = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that the rating of episodes are decreasing. The sharpest decrease can be observed *between seasons 4 and 5** (on average the ratings descreased by `r round(season_averages[4,2] - season_averages[5,2], 2)`)

# Recommended episodes

Because each *Black Mirror* episode contains self contained story, one can choose which episodes to watch and which to skip. Below, there is a list of top 5 episodes by IMDb users' rating.

```{r}
#| output: true

ratings[order(ratings$Rating, decreasing=TRUE),] %>% head() %>% kable(row.names = FALSE, align="c")
```

And below, there are 5 worst episodes.

```{r}
#| output: true

ratings[order(ratings$Rating, decreasing=FALSE),] %>% head() %>% kable(row.names = FALSE, align="c")
```
